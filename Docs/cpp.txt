Memory model
============

https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-memory-model

- Single threading                      STRONGEST
    - One control flow
- Multithreading
    - Tasks
    - Threads
    - Condition variables
- Atomics
    - Sequential consistency
    - Acquire-Release semantics
    - Relaxed semantics                 WEAKEST

Contract
--------

The stricter the contract - the less options for the compiler to optimize.
Weaker contract -> more options to optimize.


Sequence points: Points in the program at which the effects of all instructions
--------------   before must be observable.

For example, the start or the end of the functions are sequence points.
But i.e. the arguments passed to the function are evaluated in unspecified
order. The comma operator is not a sequence point.

The more **weaker** the memory model - the more difficult to write the
program and more care taken is needed.

**Sequential consistency** is the **strong memory model**.
**Relaxed semantics** is the **weak memory model**.


- Atomic operations:
    Operation executed atomically.
